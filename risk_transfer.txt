-Risk transfer of financing type
	Seek external sources (from 3rd party) to finance the loss
	Transfer responsibility of loss but still keep the activity
-Insurance risk transfer: transfer financial responsibility to insurance company
-Non-insurance risk transfers
	Leases: tenant is responsible for all property. If they fail, landlord will take this responsibility -> security deposit
	Hold harmless agreement: someone accept risks for you via a contract(contractor doing projects for you)
-Retention
	retain exposure to loss by not buying insurance (or with deductible insurance)
	Funded: a fund is set every period to pay for the losses-> better for predictable and severity loss
	Unfunded: pay for loss as they occur ->better for low frequency loss and low in severity 
	Active: deliberate decision to practice retention
	Passive: unaware that they are exposure to loss (ex: tenants assume landlords have property insuranceb but they dont)
-Self insurance
	Planed and funded retention
	Formal program: make deliberate decision to not buy insurance and not transfer the risk outside -> build an internal funding vehicle...
	Pros:
		flexibility (since insurance contracts are standardized and State-controlled)
		time value of money
	Cons:
		Catastrophic loss posibility (one big loss -> done)
		Have to perform administration functions yourself
		Poor public relation
		Hard to return to insurance market
		Income Tax Treatment:
