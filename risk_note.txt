-Loss = certainty (a certain loss has 100% chance)
-Risk != probability of loss
-Risk = uncertainty (unknown outcome)
	Pure risk: 2 outcomes/states: loss/no loss
	Speculative Risk: 3 states: gain, loss or no gain/loss

-Static risk: does not change over time (dead, sickness...)
-Dynamic risk: can be changed with circumstances (new stuff such as cyber risk)
-Measurement of risk
	Subjective risk: individual view of uncertainty (airplane travel)
	Objective risk: risk is uncertainty concernint a LOSS. (calculate VARIATION based on Expected losses and actual losses)
		AL-EL/EL

-Sources of Pure Risk:
	Personal: human capital (ability to generate income, injury, death...), retirement (loss in income, high medical expense)
	Property (physical assets, theft/damage) and Lialibity (liability exposure, law suit)
-Factor affecting Risk:
	Peril: immediate cause of loss (fire, flood, theft)
	Frequency of the loss
	Severity of loss (conditional upon Frequency)
	Hazard: identified based on increase of frequency, severity or both
		Physical hazard: Location (flood peril ->living near the shore = physical hazard since severity/frequency increase)
		Construction (fire peril-> wood structure = physical hazard)
	Moral Hazard: act different because of the existence of Insurance
		Insurance fraud, Arson
		Presnece of Insurace = change in behavior
	Morale Hazard: careless concerning losses. HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH INSURANCE
