-Risk control options:
	Attemps to control the risk
	Reduce frequency/severity of the loss to 0
	Improve predictability of the loss
-Avoidance
	Stop engaging the activity causing loss
	Risk reduce to 0
	Cons: some risks cannot be avoided (death, natural disaster), or avoidance are not desirable (profittable)
		Legacy cost
		Avoid by trading one risk for another which is more risky
	Pros: when cost of risk > profit from risk
		Strategy is mutually exclusive to all other options
-Loss prevention
	Reduce frequency/severity (not eliminate it)
	Activities that interrupt chain of events that lead to loss
	Ex: training program, control checks ...
	Assume that loss will occur -> what can be done prior to or after the loss to lessen the amount of loss
	->reduce severity
	Post loss: legal defenses (hire a lawyer), crisis management
-Separation of Exposure unit
	Break down activities to smaller part (one big truck to small trucks)
	Limit size of loss
	Reduce net income loss
	Lower coefficient of variation -> reduce risk
	Might increase cost, risks of loss of multiple units
