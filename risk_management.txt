-Steps in risk management process
	1.Identify loss exposure 
		-Loss exposure: posibility of a financial loss when peril strikes valuable things
			Most crucial step
		-How to identify? inspection, contract analysis (lease, agreement), look at past info, share loss info, checklists/survey, flow chart, ask employees, financial statement approach (balance sheets; liabilities, income, budget...)
		- Categories of loss exposures 
			Property: real property (land) and personal property (tangible: equipment, intangible: goodwill, trademark)
				Legal interest in property: ownership interest (most common, can have present or future ownership interest)
			Net income (Business Interuption): occur after some other type of loss occurs  
				(Normal productive process is interrupted that impacts net income)
				Ex: Delivery truck is stolen (property loss) -> extra cost (rent another truck, decrease in revenue) is net income loss exposure
			Personnel: when a key employee suffers a personal loss (died, sick, ...)
				That person loss income, increase medical expenses ...
				The firm suffer revenue decrease as well
			Liability (Lawsuits): bad behavior, contract breaking (intentional or unintentional)
				Legal liability: doing act that are considered negligent that causes damage/loss
				Measurement issue: establish amount of damage is usually difficult
				Measurement of loss: property losses (easy to calculate) and bodily injury: special damage (medical expenses, income loss)
					For bodily injury: general damage (intangible losses: pain, suffering from depression) -> hard to estimate
					Punitive damage: punishment damage, gross negligence (when someone know sth is illegal but doing it anyway)
				Defense to liability:
					Assumption of risk: recognize the danger involved in activity
					Comparative negligence: plaintiff was partial to blame too.

				Vicarous liability: employers are held responsible for what employees did.
				Joint and several Liability: negligence of 2 or more parties causes the damage
				Product liability: faulty product
					Cost of defending/paying injury claims
					Cost of recalling faulty product
					Brand damage
				Premises liability: damage when someone is on your location, or your property damages other property
