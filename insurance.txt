	ACV = Replacement cost - depreciation based on Replacement cost
	ACV can be thought as the price you could sale the product to someone

	A risk is insurable if price of insurance (PI) < Pmax
-Insurable risk
	6 ideal situations for a insurable risk
		Large # of similar objects, since there are lots of data-> reliable statistics can be formed (life insurance, automobiles)
			Adverse Selection (negative selection): impact on price (caused by some individuals) could lead to collapse of insurance pool
		Losses are accidental: avoid moral hazard and gambling
			To avoid fraud scam: co-pay, claim investigation, policy limit
		Losses can be determined/measured
		Losses should not catastrophic to insurer (not large # of individuals suffer at the same time)
			Ok to catastrphic to insured
			PI> Pmax
			Solutions: good underwriting, diversify risks or reinsurance (insurance company buys insurance for themselves)
		Large loss principle: dont buy insurance for things with small loss (cell phone)
		Insurable interest: if you buy insurance for some loss, you have to SUFFER from that loss if it occurs -> moral hazard and support principleof indemnity
